# **Cryptocurrencies Classification Analysis**

## **Overview**
 Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its customers. The company has asked for a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data that will be analyzed is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what the company is looking for, unsupervised learning will be used to group the cryptocurrencies. Lastly, the data will be put in visualizations to share the findings.

The project will be broken down into the following deliverables:
- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
